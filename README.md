Slot Machine
================

Author: Ian P (ippavlin)

A slot machine written in VB.NET to experiment with combining images and timers in order to
cause an "animated" look. All images were made by me (larger versions appear blurry, however).

Started: August 31, 2011 // "Completed": September 1, 2011 (minus sounds)

- A fairly basic slot machine-type "game"
- Timer is used to "animate" the slots by switching pictures
- Could either use a button to stop all at once (1 timer) or 3 individual buttons (3 timers)
	* Implemented with 1 Stop-All button
- Sound effects could be made at http://www.soundation.com/ in the future.

Image information:

- /res/main holds images such as the title image
- /res/game holds images related to the game
- smaller versions of fruit are named FRUIT_<TYPE>_SM.PNG
- larger versions of fruit are named FRUIT_<TYPE>.PNG
- should implement file-verification checks to make sure they do exist.
